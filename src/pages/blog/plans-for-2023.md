I hope this blog post finds you well. This is just a short recap of what happened
to me this year. Well alot happened met new people made some new connections, fell
out of touch with some. Although I did learn from everyone I met even though the
time spent with them was short. The most important thing I learnt is be open to new
ideas and perspectives. Not everyone see's the world in your view, and also ask for
help if you are stuck otherwise you won't get anywhere lol.

This year I didn't manage to do much about goals and completing projects, I plan on
changing that next year. Next year I plan to set out projects and goals and find a
way to complete them on time. The reason why I started this blog posting is to make myself accountable. This is also to post what am working on, or what am struggling with.
I feel like this would be a better way to ensure that I stay on track that way I finish what started in the first place.

Next year I plan to read some more books there's a saying 'Knowledge Is Power'. So I
mean why not read then lol. I do also plan to finish some overdue projects, that have
been hanging for a while. Will just be updating them within the blog posts.
Till the next post see you here :)
