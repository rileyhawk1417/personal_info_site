My journey with open source has been a interesting ride. From trying to figure out
how an open source project works, to opening pull requests. Truth be told it was
scary at first and I had imposter syndrome, still do actually. Although I learnt
that you always have to start somewhere. Just like how a journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step(grin_emoji).
<br />
\
When learning open source I didn't have a specific skillset I just wanted to try and
learn anything I could. I also liked the idea of creating what I want when I want, and
how I want it to be. I only realized later that not everyone likes the idea of open
source, so most of my favourite apps werent available for me to modify (sweat_emoji).
<br />
\
That did not stop me though I just kept finding projects that interest me and try find some that I would like to work on, which I still do. Whether its fixing a small issue,
reporting a bug or trying to write some documentation as long as its something. For me
am always open to learning new things from people and connecting with them. The beauty
about open source is that you meet amazing people, that are willing to help.
<br />

Of course you do come across some people that hinder your growth and make you lose
confidence in yourself and try to bring you down. The world is like that, you have
the good ones, and the bad ones.
<br />
\
In order to grow I started building projects, although some of them never made it to github lol. Some projects that did make it to github are half baked or not really clear.
There are some that I have to go and finish and some I am still thinking about creating.
I got my inspiration to build projects from a developer by the name of 'Takuya'
<br />
\
He managed to build his own app and offer it as a service. The one thing he said was
"Build things that solve your own itch". I sort of have a notebook full of ideas I
wanted to do but never really implemented them. I do plan to write blog posts, for each
project that I complete. In order to keep myself on track but to also share how I did it.
<br />
\
For starters this is my very first blog post that I wrote, am even wondering if I wrote
anything that made sense or am just being all over the place (laugh_emoji). Any feedback
is welcome, as am still learning I would love to hear others opinions about my projects and blogs.
